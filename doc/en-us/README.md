Here are the things you need to learn if you are a newbie.

1. 🛠️ [Learn JavaScript Basic.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript) You need to learn (almost entire) JavaScript before you get started.
   - ❌ Remember **don't** make extensions without knowing JavaScript! This leads to unexpected bugs and code style issues.
2. 👾 [Learn about how to style & refactor your JavaScript code](./getting-started/code-style.md) to make your extension better.
3. 💡 [Learn about how to use **Eureka**](./getting-started/eureka.md) to sideload & debug your extension.
4. 🎉 [Hello world!](./getting-started/hello-world.md) Try making a simple `fetch` extension step by step.
5. ℹ️ [Try using reporters](./getting-started/reporters.md) to return values from the extension.
6. 😎 [Learn how to ensure compatibility with Gandi](./getting-started/compatibility.md).
